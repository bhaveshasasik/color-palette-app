# Color Palette Generator

This is an AI/ML based mobile app that creates color palettes from user selected images. 
The users can either take pictures by using the camera or pick images from their gallery to get the palette. Once an image is selected, the app analyzes it and shows 
a curated palette of five main colors extracted from the image. The purpose of the app is to provide artists and designers with a source of inspiration and a tool 
for color exploration. With the generated color palette, they can incorporate the chosen colors into their creative projects, whether it be painting, digital design, 
or any other kinds of art.
